I am a postgraduate student at Central China Normal University (CCNU) and pursuing my master's under the supervision of Associate Professor Xia Li. Prior to this, I completed the bachelor's program in Management Science and Engineering at Anhui University of Finance and Economics (AUFE) as an outstanding graduate. After that, I was recommended to pursue my masterâ€™s degree at CCNU with the 1st overall grade in my major.

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on explainable and scalable machine learning/deep learning. I am also interested in the extension and combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques on graph neural networks (GNNs). Currently my applications are directed towards misinformation/disinformation detection in social networks and dynamic graph representation learning.


Update
------
I am reaching out to explore a PhD opportunity.
